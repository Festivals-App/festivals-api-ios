/**

This class is the central entry point to the FestivalsAPI framework.

To ease code organisation and structuring the FestivalsAPI framework is split into different parts which correspond to an object type stored and manged by the FestivalsAPI web service. Through the corresponding object handler you have access to the objects, their associated objects and properties.

## Available object handler:

* `FestivalHandler` for accessing festival objects.
* `ArtistHandler` for accessing artist objects.
* `LocationHandler` for accessing location objects.
* `EventHandler` for accessing event objects.
* `ImageRefHandler` for accessing image objects.
* `TagHandler` for accessing tag objects.
* `PlaceHandler` for accessing place objects.
* `LinkHandler` for accessing link objects.
